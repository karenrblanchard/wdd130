       A large part of a hotel's success is the front desk team, their tools and how they take care of the guests. This includes exceptional customer service, and mastering the computer software that they work with. These computer systems can be very overwhelming, but with BHC that worry is taken away. We host team trainings with as many as 20 people at a time. We have seen an obvious performance difference with properties that utilize these types of trainings. so call us today to schedule your team training today!

        <p>About Us</p>

        <p> Blanchard Hospitality Consulting was established by Karen Blanchard in 2023. Karen worked in the hotel hospitality industry for 7 years including management. She was inspired by the revenue consultant that she worked directly with while being a manager of a small hotel. 

            After graduating with a BS in Hospitality and Tourism Management at Brigham Young University Idaho she decided that wanted to fulfill her inspiration of hospitality consulting and becoming an entrepreneur. She decided to start her own consulting business which became BHC. 

            Karen has a true passion for the hospitality industry and serving clients who have that same passion. She strives to provide her clients with the best quality service with loyalty and competitiveness in the market.</p>
