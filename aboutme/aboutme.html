    <h2>Karen Blanchard</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Karen and I am from Reno Nevada. 
        My husband and I with our three kids bought our first home here and love it! 
        We love to be outdoors, gardening, camping in our rv, riding bikes and swimming. 
        My husband and I are the same age and grew up in Oregon in the same stake. 
        So we have known eachother since high school. I grew up in the church and have loved being
    an online student at BYU-Idaho. I have had the best instructors and experiences with my education.</p>
        <p>I am in my 4th year of being an online student and will graduate next 
            year with a bachelor's in Professional Studies, with emphasis in Human
            Resources, and Hospitality and Tourism Management. My background is in hospitality 
            mainly hotels. I would like to work in Human Resources in the hospitality industry from
        home if possible because I am a stay at home mom.</p>
        <p>I am taking this course as an elective to gain knowledge about web design and code. 
            I am going to also be workign for my sister who has her own finance company and I will be helping 
        her with her website and other customer service aspects. I am more of a technical type of student so I 
    enjoy things like excel, math and code!</p>
